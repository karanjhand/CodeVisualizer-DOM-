**Overview**

Visual DOM Representation (VDR) is an interactive tool designed to help beginner programmers debug and understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It integrates real-time syntax highlighting, code execution visualization, and AI-generated explanations, bridging the gap between writing code and understanding its effects on a rendered web page.

**Features**

Real-time Syntax Highlighting: Provides clarity while editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Interactive Code Execution Visualization: Links code to rendered DOM elements for better understanding.
AI-Generated Explanations: Offers detailed insights into code functionality for beginners.
Enhanced Output View: Displays interactive elements and highlights the corresponding code upon interaction.
Error Debugging: Pinpoints issues in the code and provides actionable solutions.

**Components**

**User Interface (UI)**
Code editor with tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
File upload support.
Run button to execute and visualize the code.

**Enhanced Output Section**
Visualizes DOM elements and their corresponding code lines.
Clickable elements show related code and explanations.

**AI Explanations**
Utilizes OpenAI's API to provide beginner-friendly explanations for selected code segments.

**Highlighting Mechanisms**
Automatically links line numbers in the editor to DOM elements and JavaScript execution lines.

**Installation**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/karanjhand/CodeVisualizerVDR

Open the html file in the editor and add your OpenAI API key in the :

Open the file VDR.html
Insert your OpenAI API key at line 440 (const apiKey = "";).
Open the VDR.html file in your preferred web browser.

**How to Use**

Write or upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the respective editor tabs.
Click the "Run Code" button to see the results.
Interact with the elements in the Enhanced Output tab:
Click on any DOM element to view the corresponding code and explanation.
Debug your code and improve functionality using insights from VDR.
Use Cases
Learning: Ideal for beginner programmers who need a clear understanding of how their code translates to web pages.
Debugging: Quickly identify problematic elements or scripts.
Teaching: Educators can use VDR to demonstrate code functionality in real-time.

**Limitations**

Supports only single-page web applications.
Limited to one file per type (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) at a time.
May face performance issues with large codebases.

**Future Enhancements**
Support for multiple files.
Optimized handling of larger codebases.
Improved code parsing for non-standard formatting.
